              <h3>Who in the heck am I?</h3>
              <p>I am a graphic artist, creative writer, and I also happen to have a passion for computer programing. This might seem like an extremely weird conglomeration of stuff. But wait, on top of all that, I am also a teacher. No, not one of those kinds of teachers. A lot of computer programming classes are taught by some dry, stuffy old professer. And, more than likely you don't want one of 'those' teachers. You want a creative writer, and perhaps someone who also dapples in art, because if you tend to be more on the creative side, that is probably the way you think anyway. And that is what you will get, logic and syntax written in a way that only a creative artist and writer, could bring you. </p>

              <h3>What is this Site for?</h3>
              <p>This site will be dedicated to the books that I write. I hope that this technological sharing of knowledge, will be helpful to you. In the summer of 2024, I released my first series of books. This series, contained 3 books, and taught the ins, and outs of working with Visual Studio Code and Python. These books were written to walk you through tackling Python using the text editing app of Visual Studio Code. It starts out with a beginner book, that was used to step you into the learning process. The next book, in this series, works you into adding visuals through something called the GUI. And then in my final book, in this series, I throw you into the deep end, when I start throwing a few advanced topics toward you. </p>

              <br>
<p>This year, I have added a new book, which will fall outside of the original series. With this brand-new book, I will be introducing the concepts of Flex box, to use while creating web sites to make those screen layouts behave a bit better, and be responsive, while transitioning through the different screen sizes, which we have available to us today.</p>

            <p>Come on, go ahead, Get your Geek on. It doesn't matter if you have always thought of yourself as a right brained artist all of your life, even the most creative among you can now tout their new nerdy knowledge. </p>

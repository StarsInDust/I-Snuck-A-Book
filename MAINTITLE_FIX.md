# Typography Fix: Why Your .mainTitle Wasn't Working

## The Problem ❌
You correctly identified the issue and added `class="mainTitle"` to your Solution-Files.html, but it still didn't work because:

**The CSS files were missing the `.mainTitle` rules!**

## What Was Missing 🔍

### Solution-Page.css
- Had no `.mainTitle` styles defined
- Only had `.h1Special` and other styles
- Your class change had nothing to target

### Product-Page.css  
- Also missing `.mainTitle` styles
- Would have the same problem

## What I Fixed ✅

### 1. **Added .mainTitle to Solution-Page.css**
```css
.mainTitle, 
header .mainTitle,
#container header .mainTitle {
    font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif !important;
    font-size: 28px !important;
    font-weight: bold !important;
    color: #E7C88F !important;
    text-align: center !important;
    text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) !important;
}
```

### 2. **Added .mainTitle to Product-Page.css**
Same consistent styling for the Books-Products page

### 3. **Added Responsive Typography**
All three page-specific CSS files now have:
- Small screens: 24px titles
- Medium screens: 28px titles  
- Large screens: 32px titles

## Site-Wide Consistency Now ✅

All pages now have identical `.mainTitle` styling:
- **Home.css** ✅ (already had it)
- **Solution-Page.css** ✅ (just added)
- **Product-Page.css** ✅ (just added)

## The Lesson 📚

When you change HTML classes, you need corresponding CSS rules in the page-specific CSS file. Each page loads different CSS files:

- `index.html` → `Home.css`
- `Solution-Files.html` → `Solution-Page.css`  
- `Books-Products.html` → `Product-Page.css`

## Result 🎉

Your `class="mainTitle"` changes will now work perfectly across all pages with beautiful, consistent serif typography!

**Technical Note**: The `!important` declarations ensure these styles override any conflicting rules from the complex `myStyles.css` file.

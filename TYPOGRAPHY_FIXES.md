# Typography Fixes for Home Page

## Problem Identified ✅
You were absolutely correct! The typography hierarchy was broken because:

1. **Missing Font Specifications**: The `.mainTitle` class only had `text-align: center` but no `font-family`
2. **CSS Conflicts**: Multiple responsive rules in `myStyles.css` were overriding your intended serif fonts
3. **Inconsistent Navigation**: Nav text was not properly styled
4. **Specificity Issues**: Your styles were being overridden by more specific selectors

## Typography Philosophy Applied ✅

### Headings (Serif - Elegant & Traditional)
- **Main Title**: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif
- **Subheadings**: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif
- **Purpose**: Creates elegance, authority, and classic book-like feel

### Navigation & Body Text (Sans-serif - Clean & Readable)
- **Navigation**: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif  
- **Body Text**: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif
- **Purpose**: Better readability for functional elements

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Home.css - Complete Overhaul**
```css
/* Robust typography hierarchy */
.mainTitle {
    font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif !important;
    font-size: 28px !important;
    font-weight: bold !important;
    text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) !important;
}

/* Clean navigation */
nav ul li a {
    font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif !important;
    font-weight: 600 !important;
}
```

### 2. **HTML Structure Cleanup**
- Fixed missing space in navigation attribute
- Added semantic `<main>` element
- Added proper alt attributes for accessibility
- Cleaned up excessive whitespace

### 3. **Responsive Typography**
- Small screens: 24px titles
- Medium screens: 28px titles  
- Large screens: 32px titles
- All maintain serif font family

## Design Principles Applied

1. **Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between heading and body text
2. **Readability**: Sans-serif for navigation (better at small sizes)
3. **Elegance**: Serif for titles (more sophisticated, book-like)
4. **Consistency**: Responsive scaling maintains font families
5. **Authority**: Text shadow adds depth to main title

## Result
- ✅ Elegant serif headings that match your vision
- ✅ Clean, readable navigation
- ✅ Professional typography hierarchy
- ✅ Consistent across all screen sizes
- ✅ No more conflicts with myStyles.css

Your instinct was absolutely right - headings should be fancier than body text!
